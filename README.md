### About this project
I just wanted to practice React so I came up with a simple app that allows to set a timer, pause it, stop ip and reset it, as well as getting alerts.

### Main points
- Dealing with states and promises
- Working with delays
- Using Tailwind to have smooth transitions
- Deployed in netlify
